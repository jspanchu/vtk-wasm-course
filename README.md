In order to follow along the VTK.wasm course, you will need to have these tools installed on your system.

**Windows/macOS/Linux**

- Git.
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker or Podman

You do not need the VTK source tree. In the course and homework exercises, you will use the vtk-wasm-sdk docker image which already has a complete VTK.wasm installation.

The sample code and homework is hosted at https://github.com/jspanchu/vtk-wasm-course/
